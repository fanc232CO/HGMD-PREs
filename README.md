The first is the chromosome position of the repeat.
The second is the motif of the repeat. For NR-region (non-repeat region) this value is "."
The third is the genomic functional region where the repeat is located. For NR-region (non-repeat region) this value is none.
The latter ones are other attached information such as sequence of the repeat, rsID of mutation, etc.
